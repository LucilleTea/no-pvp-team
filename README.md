# No PvP Team

This mod replaces the functionality of the friendlyFire team option to instead prevent PvP if either player involved has the option enabled.
Thus players can have their PvP status managed via teams.

I wanted to add it as a new team option, but, that's hard.

Additionally, it prevents players from placing lava buckets directly on each other when PvP should be disallowed due to the team-based rule.
